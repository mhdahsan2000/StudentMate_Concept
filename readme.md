Abstract

In Today’s world, social media is highly prevalent and at the same time very influential. Social media can connect people, help people find jobs, improve one’s mental health, help you find better deals, help you sell your business and more. In essence, many such platforms have become part of our daily lives. A social media platform that is designed exclusively for university students can help them connect with classmates, enrol into subjects, and at the same time adjust their study plan all through the dedicated application. More Importantly, this can be very beneficial for students in the first year of college and can significantly improve their mental
health and confidence while attending university resulting in improved performance. The application can also help students understand and learn concepts better through collaborative
learning creating better results. Through this project, we have designed an all-in-one mobile application “Studentmate” for university students to connect with each other at the same time, help with their studies and study plan. In addition to it, through such an application we have also introduced more features befitting for a university student.

Key words: Social computing, Mobile application, social media application, social networking platform.
